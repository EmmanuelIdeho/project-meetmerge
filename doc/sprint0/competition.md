## Competitor Analysis

### **1. Calendly** ([https://calendly.com](https://calendly.com))
- **Strengths**: Industry leader in scheduling, integrates with Google Calendar, Outlook, and Zoom.
- **Limitations**: Focuses on individual availability rather than combining multiple people's schedules into one event.

### **2. LettuceMeet** ([https://lettucemeet.com](https://lettucemeet.com))
- **Strengths**: Lightweight and simple meeting coordination tool.
- **Limitations**: Requires manual entry of availability rather than syncing directly from shared calendar links.
- **Key Differentiator**: The **MeetMerge** automatically extracts available slots from links instead of relying on manual input.

### **3. Doodle** ([https://doodle.com](https://doodle.com))
- **Strengths**: Popular for polling multiple users for availability.
- **Limitations**: Users must manually select available times, which can be time-consuming.
- **Key Differentiator**: The **MeetMerge** eliminates the need for polling by automatically detecting common available slots from linked calendars.
