## How We Organized Our Team

We decided to split up the work based on what each of us is good at. Our team is just three people, so we had to be smart about who does what:  

- **Emmanuel** is handling the setup stuff, designing how the app will look, and writing technical docs.  
- **Rebecca** took on the summary, looking at competitors, and figuring out who would use our app.  
- **I (Amir)** am in charge of the product backlog and keeping track of all our tasks.  

We didn't want to have one "leader" – instead, we each kind of lead our own areas but make big decisions together. This worked pretty well since we all got to contribute ideas but also had clear responsibilities.

## Tools We're Using  

We're using a few different tools to stay organized:  

- **GitHub** for storing our code and tracking versions. This has been super helpful when we need to see who changed what.  
- **WhatsApp** is our main way of talking to each other – we have a group chat where we post updates and ask questions. It's been good for quick discussions without having to schedule a meeting.  
- **Google Docs** for writing first drafts of documents. We can all edit at the same time which saves a lot of back-and-forth.  
- **Trello** boards to track all our user stories and tasks. It helps seeing everything laid out visually.  
- Sometimes we just **text each other directly** if something is urgent.  

Even though our schedules are pretty different (**Emmanuel has classes when Rebecca is free, and I work part-time**), these tools helped us stay in touch and keep track of everything.

## How We Make Decisions  

For most decisions, we try to reach agreement through discussion. Usually, it goes like this:  

1. Someone (often me) will throw out an idea in the WhatsApp group.  
2. The others will comment on it, suggest changes, or bring up concerns.  
3. We talk through the pros and cons – sometimes this gets pretty detailed!  
4. If we can't all agree naturally, we just vote and go with what **2 out of 3 people** want.  
5. For technical stuff, we usually trust whoever knows the most about that particular thing.  

That's how we decided on our **Calendly Combiner** idea. We each pitched a few app ideas but ended up going with this one because we've all struggled with finding meeting times that work for everyone. Just last semester, I was in a group where we spent **30 minutes** just trying to find a time to meet!

## How We Prioritized User Stories  

We used something similar to the **MoSCoW method** from class to figure out which features to build first:  

- **Must-haves**: The core stuff our app can't work without (like being able to input calendar links and find overlapping times).  
- **Should-haves**: Important features that would make the app much better (like filtering by date range).  
- **Could-haves**: Nice features that aren't critical for our first version (like user accounts).  
- **Won't-haves**: Cool ideas we wrote down but know we probably won't have time for.  

For estimating how difficult each story would be, we did a simple version of **Planning Poker**:  

1. Each of us would think about how many points a story should be (**1, 2, 3, 5, or 8**).  
2. We'd all send our numbers in the WhatsApp chat at the same time.  
3. If someone gave a story an **8** and someone else gave it a **1**, we'd talk about why we saw it so differently.  
4. Usually, after talking it through once or twice, we'd agree on a number.  

This worked pretty well – we usually only needed to discuss for a minute or two before agreeing. A couple of the more technical stories took longer to figure out, especially the ones involving **calendar APIs** since none of us had worked with those before.

## When and How We Meet  

Since we're all busy with other classes and work, we set up a **meeting schedule** that works for everyone:  

- **Quick daily updates** in WhatsApp (just saying what we're working on or if we're stuck).  
- **One bigger video call** (about an hour) at the start of each sprint to plan everything out.  
- **A 30-minute check-in** each week to make sure no one is blocked.  
- **Random calls as needed** when something complicated comes up.  

We try to schedule our video calls **around lunchtime** when we're all available. If someone can't make a meeting, we make sure to take good notes and send a summary in the group chat.

## What We Learned So Far  

Now that we're wrapping up **Sprint 0**, here are some things we've learned:  

1. **Being really clear about who's doing what saved us a ton of confusion.** At first, we were a bit vague about responsibilities and ended up accidentally duplicating some work.  
2. **Taking the time to document decisions has been super helpful.** There were a couple of times when we forgot why we made a certain choice, and having it written down saved us from rehashing the same discussions.  
3. **We should have researched the calendar APIs earlier.** We spent the first week discussing features without knowing what was actually possible with the APIs and had to scale back some ideas later.  
4. **It's been tricky finding the right balance between working independently and collaborating.** Some tasks go faster when we work alone, but others really need everyone's input.  
5. **Our daily WhatsApp updates have been crucial.** There were a couple of times when someone was heading in the wrong direction, and we caught it early because of these check-ins.

## For Sprint 1, We Want to Improve By:  

- Setting up a **better system for reviewing each other's code**.  
- Making **more detailed specs** before we start coding.  
- Being clearer about exactly **what "done" means** for each task.  
- Starting to **set up tests early** so we don't have to scramble later.  
- Getting better at **estimating how long tasks will take** (we were way off on some of our Sprint 0 estimates!).
