# Calendly Combiner

## Project Summary

### Part 1: The Project Objective

The **Calendly Combiner** is a simple application that allows users to paste multiple **Calendly** or **Google Calendar** share links and automatically finds the overlapping available times across all provided schedules. The application then generates a new **Calendly** event with only those overlapping time slots or autofills a **LettuceMeet** schedule to streamline the meeting coordination process. This tool eliminates the hassle of manually checking multiple schedules to find a common time, making group scheduling effortless.

#### **Persona 2: Steve – The University Professor**
- Steve regularly schedules office hours, research meetings, and committee sessions with students and faculty.
- With different people using different calendar platforms, Steve needs an easy way to consolidate schedules and find the best common availability for everyone.

#### **Persona 3: Wanda – The University Student**
- Wanda juggles multiple commitments, including classes, group projects, and extracurricular activities.

### Part 3: The Key Scenarios

#### **Scenario 1: Coordinating a Team Meeting Across Different Calendars**
- Peter must schedule strategy meetings with the external teams, designers, and engineers.
- Everyone shares their **Calendly** and **Google Calendar** links.
- The **Calendly Combiner** extracts the available time slots from all the links, identifies the overlapping slots, and creates a new **Calendly** event with only the common available times for the team.

#### **Scenario 2: Setting Up Research Meetings**
- Steve wants to coordinate a research discussion with faculty members from multiple universities, all using different calendar systems.
- Steve pastes their shared calendar links into the **Calendly Combiner**.
- The tool finds and suggests the best available meeting time and autofills it into **LettuceMeet** for easy confirmation.

#### **Scenario 3: Scheduling a Group Project Meeting**
- Wanda is working on a group project with four classmates, each with different class schedules and commitments.
- Instead of manually comparing schedules, Wanda collects everyone’s shared calendar links and pastes them into the **Calendly Combiner**.
- The tool identifies the best available times and allows Wanda to create a meeting event with minimal effort.

### Part 4: The Key Principles

#### **Simplicity Over Complexity**
- The tool should be intuitive and require minimal manual input.
- Users should be able to paste links, click a button, and instantly get a new **Calendly** link or autofilled **LettuceMeet** schedule.

#### **Accuracy Over Approximation**
- The system must ensure precise synchronization across different time zones and calendar settings.
- Avoids scheduling conflicts and misunderstandings.
