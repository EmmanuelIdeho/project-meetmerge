# Calendly Combiner

## Project Summary

### Part 1: The Project Objective

The **Calendly Combiner** is a simple application that allows users to paste multiple **Calendly** or **Google Calendar** share links and automatically finds the overlapping available times across all provided schedules. The application then generates a new **Calendly** event with only those overlapping time slots or autofills a **LettuceMeet** schedule to streamline the meeting coordination process. This tool eliminates the hassle of manually checking multiple schedules to find a common time, making group scheduling effortless.

### Part 2: The Key Personas

#### **Persona 1: Peter – The Project Manager**
- Peter frequently coordinates meetings with team members and external partners.
- With multiple stakeholders using different scheduling tools, Peter struggles to efficiently find mutually available time slots.
- The **Calendly Combiner** will save Peter valuable time by automating this process.

#### **Persona 2: Steve – The University Professor**
- Steve regularly schedules office hours, research meetings, and committee sessions with students and faculty.
- With different people using different calendar platforms, Steve needs an easy way to consolidate schedules and find the best common availability for everyone.

### Part 3: The Key Scenarios

#### **Scenario 1: Coordinating a Team Meeting Across Different Calendars**
- Peter needs to schedule strategy meetings with the external teams, designers, and engineers.
- Everyone shares their **Calendly** and **Google Calendar** links.
- The **Calendly Combiner** extracts the available time slots from all the links, identifies the overlapping slots, and creates a new **Calendly** event for the team with only the common available times.

#### **Scenario 2: Setting Up Research Meetings**
- Steve wants to coordinate a research discussion with faculty members from multiple universities, all using different calendar systems.
- Steve pastes their shared calendar links into the **Calendly Combiner**.
- The tool finds and suggests the best available meeting time and autofills it into **LettuceMeet** for easy confirmation.

### Part 4: The Key Principles

#### **Simplicity Over Complexity**
- The tool should be intuitive and require minimal manual input.
- Users should be able to paste links, click a button, and instantly get a new **Calendly** link or autofilled **LettuceMeet** schedule.

#### **Accuracy Over Approximation**
- The system must ensure precise synchronization across different time zones and calendar settings.
- Avoids scheduling conflicts and misunderstandings.
