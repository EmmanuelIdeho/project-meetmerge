## Scope of the Project  

### Epics / Key Features
- Multi-link input & validation (Calendly & Google Calendar)
- Google OAuth integration
- Fetch & normalize availability across time zones
- Identify overlapping time slots
- Display mutual availability in a clean UI
- Generate a new Calendly event or Lettucemeet poll with selected times

## Additional Notes
- Initial authentication issues resolved by aligning frontend redirect URI and backend callback URI.
- API call errors fixed by updating the `/calendar/free-slots` route to `/frontslots`.
- `google-api-client` library version conflict resolved by adjusting dependencies.
