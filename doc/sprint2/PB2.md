After discussing with my team, we've put together these user stories for our calendar combiner app. We tried to cover all the essential features we'll need plus some nice-to-have stuff for later sprints.

## **Core User Stories**  

### 1. Link Input  
- **As a user,** I want to paste multiple Calendly links into the app so I can find when everyone is free without manually checking each calendar.  
#### Criteria for satisfaction:  
  - The interface should let me paste at least **5 different Calendly links**.  
  - The system should **check if the links are valid Calendly URLs**.  
  - I should get **an error message** if I paste an invalid link.  
  - Should be able to **add links one by one or all at once**.  

### 2. Google Calendar Support âœ… (Completed)  
- **As a user,** I want to paste Google Calendar links too, since not everyone uses Calendly.  
#### Criteria for satisfaction:  
  - System needs to **work with Google Calendar sharing links**.  
  - It should correctly **pull availability info** from these Google Calendar links.  
  - Users should be able to **mix Calendly and Google Calendar links together**.  

### 3. Calendly API Integration âœ… (Completed)  
- **As a user,** I want the system to integrate with Calendly's API to pull availability data more efficiently.  
#### Criteria for satisfaction:  
  - System should **authenticate with Calendly API** to retrieve availability.  
  - Calendly availability should be **fetched directly** instead of relying only on shared links.  
  - The integration should **handle errors gracefully** if Calendly's API is down.  

### 4. Yahoo Calendar Integration (Replacing Outlook API) ðŸš§ (In Progress)  
- **As a user,** I want to integrate my Yahoo Calendar since we are moving away from Outlook API due to technical issues.  
#### Criteria for satisfaction:  
  - System should **connect to Yahoo Calendar API** to pull availability.  
  - It should allow users to **mix Yahoo Calendar with Google Calendar and Calendly**.  
  - The integration should handle **time zone differences**.  

### 5. Finding Overlapping Times  
- **As a user,** I want the app to show me when everyone is available at the same time.  
#### Criteria for satisfaction:  
  - System needs to **accurately find times** that work for everyone.  
  - It should handle **different time zones correctly**.  
  - Results should clearly **show the date and time ranges** that work.  

### 6. Showing Results Clearly  
- **As a user,** I want to see the available times in an easy-to-understand format.  
#### Criteria for satisfaction:  
  - Results should **look like a calendar view**.  
  - Times should be displayed in **my local time zone**.  
  - If there are **no overlapping times**, it should tell me that.  

### 7. Creating a New Calendly Link  
- **As a user,** I want to generate a new Calendly link with just the overlapping times so I can send one link to everyone.  
#### Criteria for satisfaction:  
  - System **creates a new Calendly event** showing only times when everyone is free.  
  - The link should actually **work when people click it**.  
  - I should be able to **give the event a custom name and description**.  

### 8. Lettucemeet Integration  
- **As a user,** I want to create a Lettucemeet poll with the overlapping times since some people prefer that.  
#### Criteria for satisfaction:  
  - System should **pre-fill a Lettucemeet poll** with the times that work for everyone.  
  - The link should **work correctly**.  
  - I should be able to **add a title and description** for the poll.

## **Sprint Planning Update**  
We **completed Google Calendar and Calendly API integrations**, but **Outlook API had too many issues**. Instead, we are now **working on Yahoo Calendar integration** as a replacement. Our focus in the next sprint will be **finalizing Yahoo integration and improving the overlap detection algorithm**.
