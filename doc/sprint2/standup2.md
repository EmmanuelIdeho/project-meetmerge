2. **What do you commit to next?**
   - Implement time slot extraction from valid links.
   - Begin developing the overlap comparison algorithm.

3. **When do you think you'll be done?**
   - Time slot extraction: by **April 2**.
   - Overlap algorithm: by **April 3**.

4. **Do you have any blockers?**
   - Need clarification on how recurring events should be handled across different platforms.
